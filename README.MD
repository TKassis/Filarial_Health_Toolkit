# Filarial Health Toolkit
LabVIEW VIs used to acquire video of adult filarial parasites and quantify their motility.

_Please note this code is not production ready. It was put together quickly for a research project, but it works well._

## Installation
These LabVIEW VIs were originally written in LabVIEW 2015:

1. LabVIEW 2015 (or another compatible version)
2. NI Vision Development Module 2015 (or another compatible version)

Simply clone the repository to your own computer.

## Usage
See paper.

## Contributors
If you have any improvements in mind please feel free to contribute to the project via Github. Make sure you use LabVIEW 2017 for any updates. If you encounter issues running any part of the VIs please raise the issue on Github and I'll try to address it.
